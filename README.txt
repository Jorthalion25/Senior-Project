Maven instructions for Alexa Skill:

cd into the project directory (adventure_creator_skill/)

from the command line type: mvn install

this will pull all of the dependencies you need to compile

then run the command: mvn clean package

this will compile the Java files and give you ouput in the terminal
and will also build your JAR files
